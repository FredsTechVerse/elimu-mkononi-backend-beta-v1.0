## MONGODB CLUSTER

- Its simply a group of computers that can host serveral database(s) with a limit as to the aggregate of collections and space that they can take up!

- Scope is like policy in aws.
- Everything seems to be set on the fly... On the url itself ... Google apis help us do this directly.
- I have a unified response body where i send a message `   res.status(200).json({ message: "Course deleted successfully" });` or the actual file if need arises `res.json(courseData);`
- A 200 status code is send by default hence no need of defining it if we are sending some additional data .

### WORKING WITH ENVIROMENT VARIABLES

1. Exclude apostrophes , they will be placed automatically
2. KEY must always be writtend in capital letters.
